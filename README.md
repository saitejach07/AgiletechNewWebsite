### In-House Projects & Internal Access

AgileTech maintains a strict separation between public content and internal engineering resources.

- Public users can explore AgileTech’s approach and capabilities freely
- **Internal access is restricted to a dedicated action within the In-House Projects section**
- Authentication is required **every time internal access is requested**
- Access is temporary and session-based, ensuring controlled visibility
- Internal access is automatically revoked when the user exits the internal workspace

This mirrors AgileTech’s real-world security and access control practices.

- Accessible only through authenticated internal access
- Direct navigation is blocked without proper authorization
- Designed for internal workflows, analytics, and operational visibility
